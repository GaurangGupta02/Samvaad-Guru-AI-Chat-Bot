# 🤖 Samvaad-Guru-AI-Chat-Bot

This project is an advanced **Streamlit-based AI assistant** that unifies **text chat**, **document understanding**, and **image OCR** in a single interface using **LLaVA** through **Ollama**.

It allows users to:

* Chat with a local AI model (via Ollama).
* Upload multiple files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, or Images).
* Extract and use file content as chat context.
* Stream live responses with the ability to stop generation.
* Keep and revisit chat history — all inside the browser.

* 🖼️ **Image OCR Integration** — Reads visible text from uploaded images using vision capabilities.
* 🔁 **Chat History & Session Management** — View, save, and clear past conversations.
* 🛑 **Stop Generation Button** — Halt model output in real-time.
* 🧰 **Automatic DOCX Fix** — Self-corrects missing `python-docx` dependency if needed.
* ⚙️ **Polished UI** — Modern, responsive design with styled upload buttons and layout.
* ⚡ **Streamed Responses** — Watch AI output generate live as it’s produced.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/GaurangGupta02/Samvaad-Guru-AI-Chat-Bot.git
cd Samvaad-Guru-AI-Chat-Bot

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.

pip install streamlit requests PyPDF2 python-docx


### 3. Install and Run Ollama

Install Ollama from its official website:
👉 [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)

Pull the **LLaVA** model:

ollama pull llava

Then run Ollama’s local server:


ollama serve


This launches a local API at:
`http://localhost:11434`

---

## ▶️ Run the App

With Ollama running, start the Streamlit app:

streamlit run ai_hub_app.py

You’ll see the app running at:
`http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Chat Interface**

   * Type a message in the chat input.
   * The message is sent to the LLaVA model via Ollama’s API.
   * Responses are streamed back in real-time.

2. **File Upload (Docs + Images)**

   * Upload any combination of `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files.
   * The app extracts text automatically using PDF/DOCX readers or OCR for images.
   * Extracted content becomes **context** for subsequent chat queries.

3. **Chat History**

   * Session state saves recent conversations.
   * Start a new chat or revisit old ones from the sidebar.
   * Clear all history when needed.

4. **Stop Generation**

   * Instantly stop AI response generation mid-stream via the 🛑 button.
